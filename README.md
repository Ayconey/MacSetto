# MacSet
App written for portfolio purpouses, about US Mcdonald's menu using data provided by McDonald's on kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mcdonalds/nutrition-facts

I mainly focus on functionality, not on the look of the site.
Ready to deployment with docker-compose.
# 3 Main Functionalities :hammer:
- Calorie Calculator, you can add your order and page will calculate all the macro and micro nutritions about your meal.
- Menu itself, with all the nutritions and search filter.
- MacSet, set creator, you enter calorie range and app will generate random set (from US McDonald's menu) that satisfy your input.

# Some Examples :hamburger:
